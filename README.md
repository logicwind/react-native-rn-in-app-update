## How to Test In-App Updates on Android

To test this package correctly, you must publish your app to the Play Store (even if only in **Internal Testing**) ‚Äî the in-app update API only works when your app is installed via **Google Play**.

### Step 1: Upload a lower-version build (v1)

Create a signed APK/AAB with version:

```sh
versionCode 100
versionName "1.0.0"
```

Upload this build to the Play Console ‚Üí Internal Testing track.

Publish it and wait until it‚Äôs available for testers (usually within 15‚Äì30 minutes).

Install the app from the Play Store using a tester account.

### Step 2: Prepare a higher-version build (v2)

Increment version:

```sh
versionCode 101
versionName "1.1.0"
```

DO NOT UPLOAD IT YET.

This is your update version, which the Play Store will later offer as an available update.

### Step 3: Open the app (v1) with your test logic

Ensure your app runs this on launch or on button click:

```tsx
showUpdatePopup('immediate');
```

At this point, no popup will appear, because there's no newer version yet.

### Step 4: Upload the higher version (v2)

Now upload the v2 build (with versionCode = 101) to Internal Testing.

Publish and wait until it‚Äôs live for testers (can take up to 30‚Äì60 minutes).

### Step 5: Reopen the app

Reopen the installed v1 app on your test device (it‚Äôs still running versionCode = 100).

You should now see the in-app update popup, triggered by:

```tsx
showUpdatePopup('immediate');
```
